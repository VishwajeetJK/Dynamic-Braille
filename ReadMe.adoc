= Project: Dynamic Braille with Arduino UNO

In this project, I attempt to create a dynamic system which will help
not only the blind but also the blind-deaf people who suffer more since
they cannot gain knowledge either through vision nor audio. We have
recreated the braille system using servo motors which has given a
optimised working compared to DC motors. We use the Arduino uno to
program this system and display an alphabetic string on the dynamic
braille system.

Assemble the circuit
